"""Compx mice on the Nordic 52840 MCU.

This is the shared protocol of the underlying Compx/Nordic silicon, not anything
brand-specific: receivers enumerate as "Compx" and every rebrand of the chipset
speaks it -- ATK, VXE, VGN, Zaopin, Scyrox, Dareu... Adding such a mouse is just
one more ``_model`` row with its VID/PID. Reference implementation:
https://github.com/Fan4Metal/ATK_tray

Every report -- in both directions -- is 17 bytes, numbered id ``0x08``, with the
second byte selecting a sub-command. The battery query is sub-command ``0x04``:

    write   08 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 49
    read    08 04 00 00 00 02 23 00 0e 94 00 00 00 00 00 00 82
            ^id ^sub          ^st ^%  ^w  ^^^^^ voltage        ^cksum
                                 0x23 = 35%      0x0e94 = 3732 mV

Battery percent sits at offset 6; offset 7 is the wired/charging flag -- ``0`` on
the 2.4G link, ``1`` on a direct cable (confirmed from Zaopin captures reading the
same percent at offset 6 over both). Offset 5 is a status byte and offset 8-9 the
cell voltage in millivolts (~3.7 V here); neither is needed. The last byte is a
checksum -- all 17 bytes sum to ``0x55`` mod 256, so the fixed request carries a
baked-in ``0x49`` (= 73). The battery collection is usage page ``0xFF02`` (usage
``0x02``), which pins it among the several the vendor interface splits into.

The newer Nordic 54L15 silicon (e.g. ATK Zero) speaks a different, 64-byte
protocol on its own HID collection -- see :mod:`~mouse_tray.drivers.chipset.nordic54`.
