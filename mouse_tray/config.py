    Attributes:
        poll_rate:        Seconds between battery reads when the mouse is awake
                          and discharging.
        fast_poll_rate:   Seconds between reads in transient states
                          (charging, asleep, or no mouse) where we want to
                          react quickly.
        foreground_color: RGB color of the indicator digits. Under
                          ``dynamic_color`` it is also the color of the top
                          charge band (above ``MID_THRESHOLD``).
        dynamic_color:    When True, the battery-percent indicator is colored by
                          charge level: ``low_color`` at or below
                          ``LOW_THRESHOLD``, ``mid_color`` at or below
                          ``MID_THRESHOLD``, ``foreground_color`` above it.
        mid_color:        RGB color of the middle charge band under
                          ``dynamic_color``.
        low_color:        RGB color of the lowest charge band under
                          ``dynamic_color``.
        battery_icon:     When True, the charge level is drawn as a battery
                          filled to that percent instead of as digits; the exact
                          number moves to the hover tooltip. Only affects the
                          percent readout -- "no mouse", sleep and unknown-level
                          states stay textual.
        background_color: RGBA color of the icon background (transparent default).
        font:             Font file used for the digital indicator.
        text_size:        Tray digit size, ``TEXT_SIZE_MIN``-``TEXT_SIZE_MAX``
                          percent of the fitted maximum. ``TEXT_SIZE_DEFAULT``
                          (100) fills the icon; lower values shrink every
                          string proportionally.
        text_outline:     When True, the digits carry a thin contrasting
                          outline so they stay readable on a same-colored
                          taskbar. Turn it off for plain glyphs.
        app_name:         Storage/identity key -- the registry subkey that holds
                          settings and "last full charge" times, and the log
                          directory name. Kept underscore-form so those paths
                          stay stable; it is not shown to the user.
        display_name:     Human-facing app name (tray tooltip, notifications,
                          settings-dialog title). Change this freely; it does not
                          affect any stored path.
        debug:            Enable verbose DEBUG logging (raw HID reports). Can
                          also be turned on via the MOUSE_TRAY_DEBUG env var.
